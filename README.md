# Mobile-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze mobile sales data. It covers the complete process from data import and cleaning using Power Query, to custom calendar creation, data modeling, DAX measures, and visualization design.

The dashboard highlights key KPIs (Total Sales, Quantity, Transactions, Average Price), along with insights into sales by city, monthly trends, customer ratings, payment methods, and product-level performance. Users can filter data by mobile model, payment method, and brand for detailed analysis.

The repository includes the .pbit file and a screenshot of the dashboard. Open the file in Power BI Desktop to explore and interact with the report.
